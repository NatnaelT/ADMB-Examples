  abstract = {This article introduces Rcapture, an R package for capture-recapture
	experiments. The data for analysis consists of the frequencies of
	the observable capture histories over the t capture occasions of
	the experiment. A capture history is a vector of zeros and ones where
	one stands for a capture and zero for a miss. Rcapture can fit three
	types of models. With a closed population model, the goal of the
	analysis is to estimate the size N of the population which is assumed
	to be constant throughout the experiment. The estimator depends on
	the way in which the capture probabilities of the animals vary. Rcapture
	features several models for these capture probabilities that lead
	to different estimators for N. In an open population model, immigration
	and death occur between sampling periods. The estimation of survival
	rates is of primary interest. Rcapture can fit the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber
	and Jolly-Seber model to such data. The third type of models fitted
	by Rcapture are robust design models. It features two levels of sampling;
	closed population models apply within primary periods and an open
	population model applies between periods. Most models in Rcapture
	have a loglinear form; they are fitted by carrying out a Poisson
	regression with the R function glm. Estimates of the demographic
	parameters of interest are derived from the loglinear parameter estimates;
	their variances are obtained by linearization. The novel feature
	of this package is the provision of several new options for modeling
	capture probabilities heterogeneity between animals in both closed
	population models and the primary periods of a robust design. It
	also implements many of the techniques developed by R. M. Cormack
	for open population models.},

  title = {{Spatially Explicit Maximum Likelihood Methods for Capture-Recapture
	Studies}},
  journal = {Biometrics},

  volume = {64},
  pages = {377--385},
  number = {0},
  abstract = {Summary. Live-trapping capture-recapture studies of animal populations
	with fixed trap locations inevitably have a spatial component: animals
	close to traps are more likely to be caught than those far away.
	This is not addressed in conventional closed-population estimates
	of abundance and without the spatial component, rigorous estimates
	of density cannot be obtained. We propose new, flexible capture-recapture
	models that use the capture locations to estimate animal locations
	and spatially referenced capture probability. The models are likelihood-based
	and hence allow use of Akaike's information criterion or other likelihood-based
	methods of model selection. Density is an explicit parameter, and
	the evaluation of its dependence on spatial or temporal covariates
	is therefore straightforward. Additional (nonspatial) variation in
	capture probability may be modeled as in conventional capture-recapture.
	The method is tested by simulation, using a model in which capture
	probability depends only on location relative to traps. Point estimators
	are found to be unbiased and standard error estimators almost unbiased.
	The method is used to estimate the density of Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo
	olivaceus) from mist-netting data from the Patuxent Research Refuge,
	Maryland, U.S.A. Estimates agree well with those from an existing
	spatially explicit method based on inverse prediction. A variety
	of additional spatially explicit models are fitted; these include
	models with temporal stratification, behavioral response, and heterogeneous
	animal home ranges.},

  abstract = {In open population capture-recapture studies, it is usually assumed
	that similar animals (e.g., of the same sex and age group) have similar
	survival rates and capture probabilities. These assumptions are generally
	perceived to be an oversimplification, and they can lead to incorrect
	model selection and biased parameter estimates. Allowing for individual
	variability in survival and capture probabilities among apparently
	similar animals is now becoming possible, due to advances in closed
	population models and improved computing power. This article presents
	a flexible framework of likelihood-based models which allow for individual
	heterogeneity in survival and capture rates. Heterogeneity is modeled
	using finite mixtures, which have enough flexibility of distribution
	shape to accommodate a wide variety of different patterns of individual
	variation. The models condition on the first capture of each animal,
	and include as a special case the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. Model
	selection is done either using Akaike's information criterion or
	by likelihood ratio tests, making available checks of different influences
	on survival rates. Bias in parameter estimates is reduced by including
	individual heterogeneity. Model selection and bias reduction are
	important in population studies and for making informed management
	decisions.},

  abstract = {We develop a class of models for inference about abundance or density
	using spatial capture-recapture data from studies based on camera
	trapping and related methods. The model is a hierarchical model composed
	of two components: a point process model describing the distribution
	of individuals in space (or their home range centers) and a model
	describing the observation of individuals in traps. We suppose that
	trap- and individual-specific capture probabilities are a function
	of distance between individual home range centers and trap locations.
	We show that the models can be regarded as generalized linear mixed
	models, where the individual home range centers are random effects.
	We adopt a Bayesian framework for inference under these models using
	a formulation based on data augmentation. We apply the models to
	camera trapping data on tigers from the Nagarahole Reserve, India,
	collected over 48 nights in 2006. For this study, 120 camera locations
	were used, but cameras were only operational at 30 locations during
	any given sample occasion. Movement of traps is common in many camera-trapping
	studies and represents an important feature of the observation model
	that we address explicitly in our application.},
