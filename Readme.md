ADMB Examples
========

This project contains examples of ADMB for fitting detection functions for line transect sampling data and Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models for estimation of survival from capture-recapture data.
ADMB code to fit fixed and mixed effect models are provided. TPL and example DAT files are provided. The CJS models can be run via the R package [marked](https://github.com/jlaake/marked). The line
transect sampling random and mixed effect models are contained in the R package [RandomScale](https://github.com/jlaake/RandomScale).

PDF files describing each example can be found above. The TPL and DAT files are
under each example sub-directory.

You can download all of the files in a [single zip](https://github.com/jlaake/ADMB-Examples/archive/master.zip).
